FFMPEG toMP3

TODO - Add a simple script that transcribes the audio to text "toTxt"

TODO - Add a simple script that translates the audio "toEnglish"

TODO - Workflow - record audio from meeting on the Laptop rather than using something that only has access to a microphone to pickup the sounds from the speakers. Then we can convert to MP3, pass to this utility to get a transscript. Then pass to ChatGPT to summarise the text into something smaller.
